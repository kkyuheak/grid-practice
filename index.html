            Front-end development refers to the part of web development that
            focuses on the visual elements of a website or application. It
            encompasses everything that users interact with directly, including
            layouts, design, buttons, text, images, and overall functionality. A

            engaging user experience (UX) through effective design and coding
            practices.
